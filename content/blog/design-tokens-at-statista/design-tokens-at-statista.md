## Preface

[Read this article from Nathan Curtis](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/naming-tokens-in-design-systems-9e86c7444676) and understand:

- What are Design Tokens?
- How can they be composed and categorized?
- Every use case is different and there is no silver bullet.

## Establish token system for your company's use case

Start with _generic/primitive_ tokens then create _semantic/system/alias_ tokens and _component/scoped_ tokens if necessary

Raw values: `#0666e5`

Primitive/generic: `blue-500`

Semantic/system/alias: `color-primary`

Component/scoped: `color-button-text-primary`

## Namespace matrix

\* Composite tokens are a combination of multiple values, also known as sub-values.

## Token types

_color_, _dimension_, _font-family_, _font-weight_, _duration_, _cubic-bÃ©zier_, _number_, additional types tbd. (_font-style_, _percentage/ratio_, _file_)

## Do's and Don'ts

Do: use alias tokens `size-100` --> `space-padding-xs` --> `spacing-desktop.small`

Don't: use exact values `font-size-12`

- These values could change and are not flexible
- Font-size 12 is not true anymore if a user increases their default font-size

## Think about a namespace that suits your system and users

If designers and developers are used to terms like _muted_ for text that stands back, then choose that instead of other terms like _neutral_ or _weak_.

Try to figure out if you can use a scaling system for sizing or typography, this minimizes complexity and maintenance and enables you to re-use generic/alias tokens

Decide how you want work work with scales:

- T-Shirt sizes are more well-known but also limited (you probably don't want to work with 3xs or 5xl)
- Numbers are more flexible but less descriptive
- Emphasis like _low_, _medium_ or _high_ are very descriptive but also very limited
  - _dropdown_, _modal_, _sticky_ is even more descriptive
- For timing e.g. _instant_, _slow_, _medium_ or _fast_

## Put tokens into json format

According to [DTCG](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/)
you can try to use tools such as:

- Figma variables
- Tokens Studio (Figma plugin)
- Zeroheight
- Supernova
- Knapsack

## Tooling

Use [style dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) to convert json into output format of choice

- JS for CSS-in-JS or Tailwind CSS
- CSS custom-props
- SCSS
