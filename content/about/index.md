# About Me

I am a frontend engineer based in Hamburg, Germany.

I currently work for <a href="https://www.statista.com" target="_blank">Statista</a>.

I specialize in HTML, CSS, Design Systems & Design Tokens as well as A11y.

Occasionally, I also work with React, Typescript and Remix.

This blog is built with <a href="https://11ty.dev" target="_blank">11ty</a>, since I like to keep things as simple as possible.
